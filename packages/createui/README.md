# Example: 

```lua
function OpenJobCenter(player)
	
	--Start by creating a new menu with "job_selection" as the id
	CallRemoteEvent(player, "KUI:Create", "job_selection", "JOB CENTER")
	
	--in this case we loop through all jobs and add option for each job and use jobs[i].job_name for the option title and i as the option id
	local i = 1
	for _ in pairs(jobs) do
		CallRemoteEvent(player, "KUI:AddOption", i, jobs[i].job_name, 'job description goes here', "Select")
		i = i + 1
	end
	--After we added all the options we show the menu
	CallRemoteEvent(player, "KUI:Show", "job_selection", true)
end
AddCommand('job', OpenJobCenter)

--player = player that clicked the option, selection = id of the option which has been pressed
function JobSelected(player, selection)
	kes.setPlayerJob(player, jobs[tonumber(selection)].job, 1)
end
--This event gets called when player click on any option in the "job_selection" menu
AddRemoteEvent("KUI:OptionClick_job_selection", JobSelected)
```
